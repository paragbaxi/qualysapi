qualysapi
=========

Python package, qualysapi, that makes calling any Qualys API very simple. Qualys API versions v1, v2, & WAS & AM (asset management) are all supported.
 
My focus was making the API super easy to use. The only parameters the user needs to provide is the call, and data (optional). It automates the following:
* Automatically identifies API version through the call requested.
* Automatically identifies url from the above step.
* Automatically identifies http method as POST or GET for the request per Qualys documentation.

Usage
=====

Check out the example scripts in the [/examples directory](https://github.com/paragbaxi/qualysapi/blob/master/examples/).

Example
-------
Detailed example found at [qualysapi-example.py](https://github.com/paragbaxi/qualysapi/blob/master/examples/qualysapi-example.py).

Sample example below.

```python
>>> import qualysapi
>>> a = qualysapi.connect()
QualysGuard Username: my_username
QualysGuard Password: 
>>> print(a.request('about.php'))

Installation
============

Use pip to install:
```Shell
pip install qualysapi
```

NOTE: If you would like to experiment without installing globally, look into 'virtualenv'.

Requirements
------------

* requests (http://docs.python-requests.org)
* lxml (http://lxml.de/)

Tested successfully on Python 2.7.

Configuration
=============

By default, the package will ask at the command prompt for username and password. By default, the package connects to the Qualys documented host (qualysapi.qualys.com).

You can override these settings and prevent yourself from typing credentials by doing any of the following:

1. By running the following Python, `qualysapi.connect(remember_me=True)`. This automatically generates a .qcrc file in your current working directory, scoping the configuration to that directory.
2. By running the following Python, `qualysapi.connect(remember_me_always=True)`. This automatically generates a .qcrc file in your home directory, scoping the configuratoin to all calls to qualysapi, regardless of the directory.
3. By creating a file called '.qcrc' (for Windows, the default filename is 'config.ini') in your home directory or directory of the Python script.
4. This supports multiple configuration files. Just add the filename in your call to qualysapi.connect('config.txt').

Example config file
-------------------
```INI
; Note, it should be possible to omit any of these entries.

[info]
hostname = qualysapi.serviceprovider.com
username = jerry
password = I<3Elaine

# Set the maximum number of retries each connection should attempt. Note, this applies only to failed connections and timeouts, never to requests where the server returns a response.
max_retries = 10

[proxy]
; This section is optional. Leave it out if you're not using a proxy.
; You can use environmental variables as well: http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies

; proxy_protocol set to https, if not specified.
proxy_url = proxy.mycorp.com

; proxy_port will override any port specified in proxy_url
proxy_port = 8080

; proxy authentication
proxy_username = kramer
proxy_password = giddy up!
